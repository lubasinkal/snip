snip â€” A Terminal Code Snippet Manager

A superfast command-line tool to save, search, view, and reuse your code snippets â€” all from your terminal. Think fzf + ripgrep but for your personal knowledge bank of code.
ðŸš€ Core User Flow (Minimal but Powerful)

# Save a snippet from file or stdin
snip save "List files in Go" < listfiles.go

# Save with tags
snip save "Basic HTTP server" --tag=go,web < server.go

# List snippets
snip list

# Search snippets by text or tag
snip search "http"
snip search --tag=go

# View or copy a snippet
snip cat 3
snip copy 3

# Delete or edit a snippet
snip delete 3
snip edit 3

ðŸ§± How It Will Work (Architecture Overview)
1. Storage:

Each snippet is saved as a file + metadata:

    Store in ~/.snipdb/ (or configurable path)


{
  "id": 3,
  "title": "Basic HTTP server",
  "tags": ["go", "web"],
  "created_at": "2025-06-25T12:30:00Z",
  "filepath": "/home/lubasi/.snipdb/snippets/3.go"
}

2. Indexing / Search

Use simple substring or fuzzy match (github.com/lithammer/fuzzysearch or fzf integration) to search through:

    Titles

    Tags

    Content

3. Clipboard Integration

    On Linux/macOS: use xclip, pbcopy, or wl-copy

    On Windows: Go bindings for clipboard (e.g. github.com/atotto/clipboard)

4. Command-line UX:
